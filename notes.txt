to get it to work 
1. i forked from the web site to my Repo (using the "fork" button)
2. then cloned it locally (command line "git clone https://github.com/blahblah/reponame" from one dir up)
3. then opened in VSCode and made sure it noted my changes
4. commited like normal
5. and then used the "..." to publish/sync with my online repo
6. from there you can go to the real repo https://github.com/blahblah/reponame and click new pull request which brings in your changes from your repo/fork
